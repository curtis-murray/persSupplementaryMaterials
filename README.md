## Supplementary Materials for "Probabilistic Emotion and Sentiment Modelling of Patient-Reported Experiences"

This repository contains the hierarchical topic structure derived from the Care Opinion (AU) corpus. 

Each topic within the hierarchy is represented as a subfolder nested within parent topics. These subfolders contain PDFs that combine a word cloud visualizing the topic's vocabulary and a dot plot illustrating the likelihood of each topic given patient-reported emotions, alongside their sentiment classifications.

### Repository Structure

- `/Topic_A`
  - `Topic_A.pdf`
  - `/Topic_B`
      - `Topic_B.pdf`
      - `/Topic_C`
          - `Topic_C.pdf`
      - ...
  - `/Topic_D`
    - `Topic_D.pdf`
    - ...
   
### Using this Repository

Users can navigate through the folders to explore topics and their respective subtopics. Each topic is named using the top three words from the topic. The word clouds reflect the frequency and relevance of terms within the topic, while the lolipop plots measure the likelihood of the topic under sentiments and emotions.
